!!• DEALLOCATE DATABLOB THINGS WHEN THE WHOLE REQUEST DOESN'T GO THROUGH!!

!• Complain instead of silently do nothing when a FormBound thing is missing required accessors!! D:

• Make the String value() parameter in the FormBoundXyz things default to "" and let the code use the field name when it's that!!
• Provide the entire ActionBean not just its context to the Type Converter Specifiers (FormBoundXyz) so that site-specific custom ones can access the site-specific context, like the database connection! X3

• Rename XyzWrapper to XyzDecorator since that's more specific (and googleable!)
	+ Decorators are Wrappers where the underlying API is the same as the exposed API
	+ Adapters are Wrappers where they're different!
	I like this nomenclature! :D
