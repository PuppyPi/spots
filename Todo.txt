!!• DEALLOCATE DATABLOB THINGS WHEN THE WHOLE REQUEST DOESN'T GO THROUGH!!

!• Complain instead of silently do nothing when a FormBound thing is missing required accessors!! D:

• Make the String value() parameter in the FormBoundXyz things default to "" and let the code use the field name when it's that!!
• Provide the entire ActionBean not just its context to the Type Converter Specifiers (FormBoundXyz) so that site-specific custom ones can access the site-specific context, like the database connection! X3
