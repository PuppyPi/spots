Stripes is a servlet+jsp mvc framework created by Tim Fennell at http://stripes.mc4j.org/

Spots is another mvc framework, but one that uses Filters for the resolving and doesn't automatically repopulate forms when they are invalid.

Spots takes alot of things from Stripes, but not everything.


Also included in spots util is a couple of classes from the Apache Commons Fileupload project
	This is because I needed to change a couple of things to make it work for Spots (namely visibility)
	An added benefit though, is that Spots has no external dependencies.

I hope there aren't any licensing issues with this.
